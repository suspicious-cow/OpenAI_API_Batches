    "Batches start with a .jsonl file where each line contains the details of an individual request to the API. For now, the available endpoints are /v1/chat/completions (Chat Completions API) and /v1/embeddings (Embeddings API). For a given input file, the parameters in each line's body field are the same as the parameters for the underlying endpoint. Each request must include a unique custom_id value, which you can use to reference results after completion. Here's an example of an input file with 2 requests. Note that each input file can only include requests to a single model.\n",
